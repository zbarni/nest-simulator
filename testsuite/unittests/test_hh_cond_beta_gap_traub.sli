 /** @BeginDocumentation
    Name: testsuite::test_hh_cond_beta_gap_traub - sli script for overall test of hh_cond_beta_gap_traub model 
    with gap_junction connection

    Synopsis: (test_hh_cond_beta_gap_traub) run -> compares response to current step with reference data 

    Description:
    test_hh_cond_beta_gap_traub.sli is an overall test of the hh_cond_beta_gap_traub model connected
    by gap_junction connection.

    Two neurons of whom one receives an constant input current of 200 pA are connected
    by gap_junction with an (unrealistic) high gap weight. The accurate functionality
    of the gap_junction feature is tested by measuring the membrane potential of the
    neuron without input current.
    
    Although 0.1 cannot be represented in the IEEE double data type, it
    is safe to simulate with a resolution (computation step size) of 0.1
    ms because by default nest is built with a timebase enabling exact
    representation of 0.1 ms.

    The expected output is documented at the end of 
    the script. The textual output of the voltmeter documented in this file
    can be regenerated by setting adding /to_screen true to the SetStatus
    call of vm below.
