  This user manual gives a short introduction to the use of the
  Topology Module for the NEST Neural Simulation Tool.

  Rüdiger Kupper wrote a first topology library for NEST many years
  ago entirely in SLI (actually, it pre-dates the NEST kernel).  Kittel
  Austvoll and Hans Ekkehard Plesser designed and wrote a completely
  new Topology library in 2007/8. That library has been available with
  the NEST~1.9.x pre-releases since.

  For NEST~2.0, Håkon Enger and Hans Ekkehard Plesser re-factored
  parts of the Topology library code, improved and extended the PyNEST
  interface for the Topology library, fixed bugs and added tests.

  For NEST~2.2, Håkon Enger rewrote most of the Topology library code,
  thereby improving performance considerably.

  This User Manual describes the NEST~2.16 version of the NEST Topology
  Library. There have been no major changes to the Topology library since
  NEST~2.2, although Topology functions check their arguments more carefully
  since NEST~2.6.

  We plan further improvements to the Topology Module in the future,
  which may include changes to the API to remove some of the remaining
  inconsistencies and provide a cleaner user interface.
