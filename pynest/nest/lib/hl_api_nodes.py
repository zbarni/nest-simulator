    Generates `n` new network objects of the supplied model type. If `n` is not
    given, a single node is created. Note that if setting parameters of the

    Parameters
    ----------
    model : str
        Name of the model to create
    n : int, optional
        Number of nodes to create
    params : dict or list, optional

        dictionaries with size n. If omitted, the model's defaults are used.

    Raises
    ------
    NESTError
